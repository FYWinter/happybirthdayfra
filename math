15 -> 25 =  
10 (unit) / 0.1 (units per increase) * 3 (increase cycle seocnds) 
= 300 (seconds)

Base time per level = 300
Additional time per level = 0.5 (extra units) / 0.1 * 3 
= 15

Calculation for completion of level X:
t - result (seconds)
n - level

t = 300 + 15X


Calculation for reaching level X from zero:
t - result (seconds)
n - target level

t = 300n + 15(n-1)n / 2


Calculation for reaching level n from level x:
t - result (seconds)
n - target level
x - starting level
